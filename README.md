Campus Placement Prediction is a ML project.

It predicts if a student will be placed based on its data like SSC-Percentage,	HSC_Percentage, Professional Degree,	Work Experience, Specialization	etc.

The data set we used for training is Pre-processes first. It includes NAN handloing and Outliers handling.

We have also implemented Data Visualizations for analyzing the dataset and then performed Encoding as well.

Finally, we have used Algorithms like Logistic regression, Random Forest and Decision Trees and compared the reults for our dataset.
