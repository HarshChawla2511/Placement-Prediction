Campus Placement Prediction is a ML model.

It predicts if a student will be placed based on its data like SSC-Percentage,	HSC_Percentage, Professional Degree,	Work Experience, Specialization	etc.

The Dataset we used for training is Pre-processeed first. It includes NAN handling and Outliers handling.

We have also implemented Data Visualizations for analyzing the dataset and then performed Hot-Encoding as well.

Finally, we have used Algorithms like Logistic regression, Random Forest and Decision Trees and compared the reults for our dataset.
